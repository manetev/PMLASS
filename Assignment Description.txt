The goal of your project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. You may use any of the other variables to predict with. 

You should create a report describing how you built your model, 

how you used cross validation, 

what you think the expected out of sample error is, 

and why you made the choices you did. 

You will also use your prediction model to predict 20 different test cases. 


1. Your submission should consist of a link to a Github repo with your R markdown and compiled HTML file describing your analysis. Please constrain the text of the writeup to < 2000 words and the number of figures to be less than 5. It will make it easier for the graders if you submit a repo with a gh-pages branch so the HTML page can be viewed online (and you always want to make it easy on graders :-).
2. You should also apply your machine learning algorithm to the 20 test cases available in the test data above. Please submit your predictions in appropriate format to the programming assignment for automated grading. See the programming assignment for additional details. 

Reproducibility 

Due to security concerns with the exchange of R code, your code will not be run during the evaluation by your classmates. Please be sure that if they download the repo, they will be able to view the compiled HTML version of your analysis.

##### question -> input data -> features -> algorithm -> parameters -> evaluation

According to the data collected  when they  did the exercice  the objective is to build a model allowing to predict if the participant perform in athe correct manner.  The correct manner is modelised by  5  classes A, B, C, D, E. 

###### Input data
Input data is provided. Available Data are a set of training data describing the measure taken for each exercice. 


###### Feature selection  
First step was to  analyse and clean the data collected.  
	- Each row correspond to an observation 
	- large number columns 160 
	- somme of them contains NA values, we choose to remove them
	-  some of them contains DIV0 values, we choose to remve them   
	-  some of them are categorical values whiche should not interfer with the manner they  did the exercice (  timestamp, name , num_windows ) 


Then,  we choose to check the nearzero variable in order to  get an idea of the value frequency. 
No more zero varibale remains. FreqRatio is not too high, all the information seems to  be valuable
